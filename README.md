# Drizzle
This project is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). A platform designed for developers and designers to effectively present their projects, featuring images, descriptions, and links. This application streamlines the process of sharing, editing, and managing projects, allowing users to highlight their work and accomplishments. The app is built using Next.js for frontend development and Firebase for backend and authentication purposes.

# Features
User Authentication: The app provides multiple authentication options, including Google, email, and password. This ensures a secure and seamless login experience for users.

Project Management: Users can add new projects to their portfolio, including project names, images, descriptions, and relevant links. This allows for comprehensive and visually appealing project displays.

Editing and Updating: Users can easily edit and update project details. This feature is particularly useful for reflecting changes and improvements made to projects over time.

Deletion: Users have the ability to remove projects from their portfolio when they are no longer relevant. This helps in maintaining an up-to-date and curated showcase.

Responsive Design: The web app is designed to be responsive, ensuring optimal user experience across various devices and screen sizes.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
